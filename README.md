# Hello, World!

Hi! We are so excited to meet you in a few weeks! Because the intern program is only 8 weeks, we want to make sure you're set up for success as soon as you complete onboarding. If you're interested in some reading material, here are some resources we thought might be helpful. 

### There is no expectation that you read these materials before the internship begins! 
We will be moving quickly through Javascript/React basics to be able to teach you the more Gusto-relevant things you need to know.
